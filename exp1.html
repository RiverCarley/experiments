                Anther Kiley is a designer, artist, and educator living and practicing in Providence, RI. He teaches in the graphic design department at RISD while maintaining a professional graphic design practice and a robust studio art practice. If that’s not enough he also runs Card Kits—a line of sustainable architectural children’s toys inspired by own childhood. His work explores the symbolic and poetic aspects of functionalist forms in the built environment through sculpture, photography, digital image making, and collage.</p>

                Emi Takahashi is an artist and graphic designer based in Toronto. Her practice involves experimenting with alternative & analog forms of image-making, glyph & type design, archival projects, and multidisciplinary collaborations. Michelle Kuan is a Chinese Canadian artist, designer, and writer based in Montréal. Working between social practice, digital arts, and experimental publishing, she explores novel ways of documenting personal and collective narratives, the power of somatic memory, and decolonial archival futures. Their research laden practices operate both individually and collectively to create a mix of client-based and self-initiated work such as their here-there stories project devoted to collecting the stories of the asian canadian diaspora.</p>
